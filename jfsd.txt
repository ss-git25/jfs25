java full stack

A] Data structures and algorithms
-Data=property/attribute of an entity
-Data structure=memoery format to store data for it's efficient use.
-Algorithm=Standared procesdure/steps which are applied on i/p data to get desired o/p.
-time/space complexity=rate at which timme/space taken by program increses wrt to i/p data size
  -time complexity-{constant time,linear time,exponential??}
  - Big O(x)  analysis -->x=1>log n>root n> n>n log n>n^2 >n![remember graph of complexities]
