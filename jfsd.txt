-log x to the base n=total number of times divide by n to given number to make it 1
  -log 32 to base 2=total number of times requires to divide by 2 to 32 to make it 1
                   = {(32/2=16),(16/2=8),(8/2=4),(4/2=2),(2/2=1)}=5

A] Data structures and algorithms
-Data=property/attribute of an entity
-Data structure=memoery format to store data for it's efficient use.
-Algorithm=Standared procesdure/steps which are applied on i/p data to get desired o/p.
-time/space complexity=rate at which timme/space taken by program increses wrt to i/p data size
  -Asympotic notation=natation representing growth trend of an alorithm (o-worst case,omega-best,theta-avg)
  -time complexity-{constant,logarithmic,linear,Linearithmic nlog n,exponential 2^n,factorial}
  - Big O(x)  analysis -->x=1>log n>root n> n>n log n>n^2 >n![remember graph of complexities]
